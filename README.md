This is a simple AutoHotKey v2 script to reproduce the basic Vim Motions using CapsLock:

When Capslock is pressed:

h,j,k,l act like arrow keys.
m and Ã¹ are pgUp and pgDown.
q and s for Home and End, respectively (they are on the home row on a French keyboard, replace with a and s on a qwerty keyboard.
yuio are used for scrolling (y and o scroll about one screen at a time for my laptop, adjust the number for your screen).
The bottom row is used for common programmming symbols like []{}<> which can be a major pain to type on a French keyboard.

**Installation**

Install AutoHotKey (https://autohotkey.com/) on your system (v2). Save the .ahk file in a convenient location. From there, you can either run it manually by double clicking on it, or copy a shortcut into your windows start-up folder to have it loaded automatically on startup.

**Configuration**

The script can be opened in any text/code editor. The shortcuts here are intended to shore up the weakness of the French keyboard layout and they work fine, but you may want to revisit some of the shortcuts, especially if you are using a different keyboard layout. The main idea is to get access to your arrow keys on the home row and have any commonly used symbol within easy access, all at the cost of the Capslock key, which most people don't use anyway.
